2;Tic-Tac-Toe in Python;Link to a github project I developed that implements the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The project uses a lot of design patterns and also dynamic programming for the AI. No external library needed :) . Enjoy it!;https://fbrunodrbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/tictactoe.png;Tic-Tac-Toe;Python,Design Patterns,DP;https://github.com/fbrunodr/Tic-Tac-Toe
3;Competitive Programming Repository;Link to a github repo I maintain that implements data structures and algorithms for competitive programming, such as Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree, Suffix Array, prefix function, z-function, etc. It also has some guides on how to use them properly.;https://fbrunodrbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/feenwickt_tree.png;Fenwick tree idea;C++,Data Structures,Algorithms;https://github.com/fbrunodr/CompetitiveProgramming
